## ✨ About the Project

**Story Inn** is a digital haven for storytellers and readers. Whether you're an aspiring writer wanting to share your imagination chapter by chapter or a reader looking for your next unforgettable story, Story Inn aims to create a warm, engaging community around the art of storytelling.
